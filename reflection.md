- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

my initial impressions of how `association` affects programming is actually quite good. i think it's a great way  to keep organised when working with different classes that rely on/use each other in different ways. it's also just very satisfing when it all comes together in the program haha. what worked for me in this assignment was taking it one step at a time in the different classes. there were times where i would start jimping ahead and thinking about how one class would be interacting with another; this didn't work for me and just made me confused. it was much easier to get (almost) everything into one class and then start thinking about integrating others with each other. advice i would give to someone taking this course is to not get ahead of yourself when working with association. just take it one class at a time and things will come together in a way that makes so much sense -- it's easy to make mistakes when trying to do everything at once and jumping back and forth between classes. obviously you'll eventually have to do that, but starting class by class, step by step, helps a lot.
